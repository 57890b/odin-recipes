    <h3>List of ingredients to make Honey Garlic Chicken Skewers (5-6 Skewers)</h3>

    <h4>Marinade</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, peeled and minced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon minced ginger</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons dark soy sauce</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons honey</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Skewers</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>2 chicken breasts, approximately 350g, chopped into bite-sized pieces</li>
        <li>1 red bell pepper, chopped into large chunks</li>
        <li>1 onion, peeled and sliced into squares</li>
        <li>3 sticks of coriander/cilantro, roughly torn</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How to make the skewers</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Combine all the marinade ingredients in a small bowl: 1 tablespoon vegetable oil, 2 cloves minced garlic, 1 teaspoon minced ginger, 3 tablespoons dark soy sauce, and 3 tablespoons honey.</li>
        <li>Place the chicken pieces in a bowl and pour three-quarters of the marinade over them (reserve the remaining marinade for basting during cooking). Cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or up to a day.</li>
        <li>If using wooden skewers, soak them in water to prevent burning, or use metal skewers.</li>
        <li>Preheat your BBQ or griddle until very hot.</li>
        <li>Thread the chicken onto skewers, alternating with chunks of red pepper and onion. Discard any excess marinade from the bowl.</li>
        <li>Cook the skewers on the BBQ or griddle for 8-10 minutes, turning 3-4 times during cooking. Brush with the reserved marinade halfway through cooking. Ensure the chicken is fully cooked by slicing open the largest piece to check for any pinkness.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the cooked skewers with torn coriander leaves before serving. Enjoy with salad and rice or potatoes, such as Greek Potatoes, if desired.</li>
