    <h3>How to make Tteokbokki</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the sauce by mixing Gochujang, sugar, soy sauce, garlic, and Gochugaru in a small bowl. If your rice cakes are frozen, soak them in warm water for 10 minutes to thaw before cooking.</li>
        <li>Combine the sauce and rice cakes in a skillet or large pan over medium heat, cover them with stock or water and bring them to a simmer. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li>Cook until the rice cakes are tender (not too chewy or hard) and the sauce thickens, this should take about 10 - 15 minutes. Add fish cakes and any other toppings of your choice halfway through cooking. If the rice cake isn't soft enough, just add more water and keep stirring until it gets softer.</li>
        <li>Serve in plates or bowls, garnished with chopped green onions and toasted sesame seeds.</li>
        <li>Optionally, top with grated cheese or serve with kimchi on the side for extra flavor.</li>
      </ol>
